# Drone Project - Funded by HackClub

This project showcases a custom-built drone, funded by HackClub. Below is an overview of the essential components, along with assembly details and functionality.

## Key Components

- **Drone Frame**: A sturdy F450 quadcopter frame with landing gear for stability.
- **Motors**: Four A2212 brushless motors ensure efficient and powerful propulsion.
- **ESCs**: Electronic Speed Controllers regulate motor speed.
- **Transmitter & Receiver**: A FlySky system enables precise remote control.
- **Accelerometer**: The MPU-6050 provides motion and orientation data.
- **Arduino Uno**: Acts as the core flight controller, running the control software.

## Assembly Process
1. **Frame Setup**: Assemble the F450 quadcopter frame with landing gear.
2. **Motor Installation**: Attach the A2212 brushless motors to the frame and solder them to the ESCs.
3. **Power Distribution**: Solder the Lipo battery to the PDB.
4. **Controller Integration**: Program the Arduino Uno with flight control software and connect the MPU-6050 accelerometer.
5. **Remote Control**: Pair the FlySky transmitter and receiver for manual flight control.
6. **Propellers**: Attach the propellers and ensure they are balanced.
